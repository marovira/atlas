         *	\class Camera
         *	\brief Defines a simple camera interface to be used with Scenes.
         *	
         *	This class provides a simple way of integrating a camera into
         *	an existing Scene. To use it, simply subclass from Camera and
         *	implement it however you like. In order to allow the user to
         *	control the camera using the mouse (this is the default provided
         *	option) override the mouse functions and implement them. 
         *	
         *	The next step is to add your camera to your Scene and simply 
         *	invoke the mouse functions within the Scene's mouse functions 
         *	and everything should take care of itself.
         *	
         *	Finally, just remember to get the camera matrix and set it to
         *	the view matrix so it can be passed down to objects when they
         *	render.
         *	
         *	The CameraMovements enum defines the standard functions that 
         *	cameras should have. While this may not cover <i> all </i> possible
         *	cameras, it should suffice for most applications. With this,
         *	it is possible to fully implement a camera that behaves exactly
         *	like the one in Autodesk Maya.
